### Tools and Libraries Used:

-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **Ethers.js**: A complete Ethereum wallet implementation and utilities in JavaScript (and TypeScript).
-   **Chakra UI**: A simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you all the building blocks you need to build your React applications.
-   **Web3-Onboard**: A tool to help developers integrate wallet connections and network switching in Dapp applications.

### Setup and Installation:
